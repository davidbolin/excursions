\usage{
continuous(ex, geometry, alpha = 0.1,
           method = c("logit", "log", "linear", "step"),
           output = c("sp", "inla"))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ex}{
    An \code{excurobj} object generated by a call to
    \code{\link{excursions}} or \code{\link{contourmap}}.
}
\item{geometry}{
  Specification of the lattice or triangulation geometry of the input.
One of
\code{list(x, y)}, \code{list(loc, dims)}, \code{inla.mesh.lattice}, or
\code{inla.mesh}, where \code{x} and \code{y} are vectors, \code{loc} is
a two-column matrix of coordinates, and \code{dims} is the lattice size
vector.  The first three versions are all treated
topologically as lattices, and the lattice boxes are assumed convex.
}
\item{alpha}{
  The target error probability.  A warning is given if it is detected
  that the information \code{ex} isn't sufficient for the given
  \code{alpha}.
}
\item{method}{
  The spatial probability interpolation transformation method to use.
  One of \code{"logit"}, \code{"log"}, \code{"linear"}, or
  \code{"step"}.  For \code{logit} and \code{log}, the probabilities are
  interpolated linearly in the transformed scale. For \code{step}, a
  conservative step function is used.
}
\item{output}{
  Specifies what type of object should be generated. \code{"sp"} gives a
  \code{SpatialPolygons} object, and \code{"inla"} gives a
  \code{inla.mesh.segment} object.
}
}
\details{
  
}
\value{
  A \code{SpatialPolygons} or \code{inla.mesh.segment} object.

  The subsets are tagged, so that credible regions are tagged \code{"-1"}, and
  regions between levels are tagged \code{as.character(0:nlevels)}.
